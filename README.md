# pepperspray_tweets
Repository of code and txt from tweets related to pepper spray.

## TM A&A

John, the Gilbert_A&A notebook contains my report for this assignment. All other notebooks in this repo are used to scrape and analyze the Twitter data. 


The Pepper_Spray_Twitter_Scrape notebook contains code to scrape seven days worth of tweets associated with the words: 'teargas', 'pepper spray', 'nonlethal', 'mace', and 'selfdefense.' There is an error in the original code which cast the output list to a string vice casting each element of the list as a string. I have made some modifications to fix this but more work is required.


The Pepper_Lexical_Analysis notebook contains the code that I used to conduct basic descriptives of this data set when I gathered it for the Data Share assignment.

I have not included my API keys in this repo; you will need to modify the code to pull from your personal keys.
